**2. Methods**
I utilized Power BI, a data analysis tool from Microsoft, to create dynamic visualizations based on sales datasets. The data was extracted from internal company sources and prepared for analysis in Power BI. Various dynamic charts were then created to explore different aspects of sales and profitability.

**3. Results**
The results include dynamic charts presenting:
- Sales report considering products and segments.
- Sales report considering countries and profit.
- Distribution of profit, sales, and units sold by country and segment.

**4. Conclusion**
The analysis of sales and profit revealed valuable insights into the company's performance. It was possible to identify the best-selling products in different customer segments, understand which countries contribute most to overall profit, and analyze the effectiveness of sales strategies in different regions and market segments. This information is essential for guiding the company's marketing, sales, and operations decisions, aiming to optimize performance and maximize profits.

**5. Use Case:**
Imagine an electronics company looking to expand its operations globally. Using the visualizations created in Power BI, the company can identify the countries where its products have the highest demand and profitability. Additionally, it can analyze which customer segments are most receptive to its products in each country. With this information, the company can direct its marketing and sales efforts to the most promising markets, adapting its strategies according to the preferences and behaviors of local customers. This enables a more efficient and profitable expansion into the global market.
